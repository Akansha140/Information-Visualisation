<td style="width: 200px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">This scatter plot shows the relationship between Fail % and Brake Test % of NCT Failure. Hovering over a point will reveal the Fail % of VehicleMake and mean percentage of Brake Test %. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">In the scatter plot, there is correlation between Fail % and Brake Test %. We can see that as the fail percentage is increasing the mean of brake test percentage is scattered.  
We can also see that there is an outlier on 0 at X-axis and Y-axis with Fail % value as 0 and mean percentage of Brake Test value as 0. The scatter plot is densely packed between 5-25 Fail % and 0-5 mean percentage of brake test.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">I have used scatter plot as it is a very effective way to show the relationship between two quantitative variables, taking advantage of our ability to accurately perceive variation in both horizontal and vertical position. The mean of each attributes is taken to get average value because the data is very large so summarized data is required for clear visualization.
 I have also encoded mean percentage of fail and mean percentage of brake test in tooltips so it is possible to do hovering over a point to see the associated value of it. I have not chosen binned heatmaps because it is least effective type of visualization. Also, it is not possible to do hovering if it is used.
</td>

<tr>
<td style="width: 200px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Data filtering and transformation:&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
I have used filter so that I can get the filtered data of VehicleMake whose models are manufactured after 2000 so that data point should be visualise clearly else it will be plotting messy scatterplot which would be difficult to visualise.
